# Concept Note (Week 3)

## Problem
Nairobi commuters face unpredictable fares, long queues, and safety incidents on matatu routes. Information is siloed in chat groups and is not time-aware, making daily decisions inefficient and risky.

## Solution
A crowdsourced web app that captures quick trip reports (fare, wait, crowding, incidents) and computes time‑bucketed reliability and safety scores per route. Commuters see live route badges and receive alerts for their saved routes.

## Users
- Commuters (primary)
- SACCO moderators (curation & reputation)
- County/NTSA (aggregate insights)

## Why now
Smartphone and WhatsApp penetration is high; open mapping (OSM) and affordable SMS/WhatsApp APIs exist; MongoDB and Firebase streamline rapid deployment.

## Differentiation
- Scores that adapt by time‑of‑day and weather
- Moderator tools + trusted SACCO badges
- Privacy-first, anonymous default reports

## MVP (8 weeks)
- Report flow, map with scores, moderation, alerts, pilot on two corridors

## Monetization (post‑MVP)
- Freemium alerts, SACCO dashboards, sponsorships

## Metrics
- 500+ reports in pilot, ±10% fare error band, <24h moderation time, 100+ DAU on two corridors
