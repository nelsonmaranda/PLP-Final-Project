# Week 2 – Discovery Notes & Interview Guide

## Hypotheses / Assumptions
- Commuters will submit quick reports if the flow is < 20 seconds.
- Fare and wait time vary strongly by time-of-day and weather.
- SACCO moderators are willing to help curate reports to improve reputation.

## Interview Targets (Nairobi)
- 5–10 daily commuters on Thika Rd, Waiyaki Way, Jogoo Rd.
- 1–2 SACCO or stage marshals; 1 county transport contact if possible.

## Questions (Commuters)
1. What time do you usually travel and which stage/routes do you use?
2. What information would help you decide when to leave (fare, queue, safety)?
3. Have you reported incidents before? Where and how? What worked/failed?
4. Would you allow anonymous location to be sent with a report?
5. How would you like to receive alerts (SMS/WhatsApp/push)?

## Questions (SACCO/Operators)
1. What issues cause delays or fare surges most often?
2. How could commuter reports be useful to you?
3. What would make a "trusted SACCO" badge meaningful and fair?

## Success Signals This Week
- At least 5 interviews completed.
- Validated top 3 data fields for report form.
- Confirmed two pilot corridors and one moderator.
